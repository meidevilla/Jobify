- Users can view a graph of job applications sent over time and track application response rates.
**4. Reminders**
- Users can add follow-up reminders for job applications.
**5. Profile Management**
- Users can update their profile details through the settings option, allowing them to update their user profile (e.g profile photo, username, name etc.)
- Users can change their password for improved account security.
